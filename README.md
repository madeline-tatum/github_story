Prompt: Simultaneously, across the world, everyone hears a voice in their head. "In 2 hours, the server will be shutting down for the final time. Thank you for playing Human ®." 

First Paragraph:
  Cars stopped, people walking on the streets froze. It's almost as if someone paused life for a split second. The message was so cryptic and unexplainable that nobody knew how to react. The silence is broken by scattered whispers. "Did you hear that too?" "What's going on?" "This is a cruel joke." Phones go off, notifications alerting of breaking news. This isn't isolated to one place, it's everywhere. Humanity is faced with the harsh reality of being nothing but a bad game of Sims. So now what? 

Second Paragraph:
  It was Club Penguin all over again. I looked down at my phone to see it being flooded with notifications from both social media and family members. Of course the people on social media weren't taking this seriously and were posting jokes and memes but my family sent many messages of concern asking what to do. How should I know? I was asking myself that same question ever since I heard it. My mind was full of many ideas but one seemed better than all the rest...

Third Paragraph:
  Not long after seeing the outside world stop spinning before my eyes, the sky began to darken. The sky darkened to a pitch black, not a normal black but an absolute black. No stars, moon, or ambient light came from the sky. The world became darker than any night on earth, street lights became beacons of white light surrounded by darkness. All lights had defined shapes and shadows looked off. The surrounding environment for what I knew began to be strange and bland, all textures of materials were disfigured and seemed broken. Like a poorly rendered video game.

Fourth Paragraph:
  Darkness falls across the town, lit by fires and street lights. Confusion and fear fills the slience. Tensions rise and riots begin to burst through the seams of tranquility. Unrest burdens us all with the weight of violence and terror. Is it all fake? Whats the point of trying? Are we all going to die? As questions continue to flood, blood continues to boil. Until, full system collapse, chaos...  

Fifth Paragraph:
  Time is running out, it might be fake but it still feels wrong to me. Is it? Countless lives lost, but really are they lost if they were never real to begin with. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't... These questions are killing me. I'm so confused. I don't know what to believe. Like can it all be just a game? Gunshots in the distance as sirens blare. What should I do? Should I leave the house, should I hide? Who cares it could all be over in an hour anyway. Then suddnenly out of nowhere the voice speaks again...
