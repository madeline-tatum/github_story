Prompt: Simultaneously, across the world, everyone hears a voice in their head. "In 2 hours, the server will be shutting down for the final time. Thank you for playing Human ®." 

First Paragraph:
  Cars stopped, people walking on the streets froze. It's almost as if someone paused life for a split second. The message was so cryptic and unexplainable that nobody knew how to react. The silence is broken by scattered whispers. "Did you hear that too?" "What's going on?" "This is a cruel joke." Phones go off, notifications alerting of breaking news. This isn't isolated to one place, it's everywhere. Humanity is faced with the harsh reality of being nothing but a bad game of Sims. So now what? 

Second Paragraph:
  It was Club Penguin all over again. I looked down at my phone to see it being flooded with notifications from both social media and family members. Of course the people on social media weren't taking this seriously and were posting jokes and memes but my family sent many messages of concern asking what to do. How should I know? I was asking myself that same question ever since I heard it. My mind was full of many ideas but one seemed better than all the rest...

Third Paragraph:
  Not long after seeing the outside world stop spinning before my eyes, the sky began to darken. The sky darkened to a pitch black, not a normal black but an absolute black. No stars, moon, or ambient light came from the sky. The world became darker than any night on earth, street lights became beacons of white light surrounded by darkness. All lights had defined shapes and shadows looked off. The surrounding environment for what I knew began to be strange and bland, all textures of materials were disfigured and seemed broken. Like a poorly rendered video game.

Fourth Paragraph:
  Darkness falls across the town, lit by fires and street lights. Confusion and fear fills the slience. Tensions rise and riots begin to burst through the seams of tranquility. Unrest burdens us all with the weight of violence and terror. Is it all fake? Whats the point of trying? Are we all going to die? As questions continue to flood, blood continues to boil. Until, full system collapse, chaos...  

Fifth Paragraph:
  Time is running out, it might be fake but it still feels wrong to me. Is it? Countless lives lost, but really are they lost if they were never real to begin with. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't... These questions are killing me. I'm so confused. I don't know what to believe. Like can it all be just a game? Gunshots in the distance as sirens blare. What should I do? Should I leave the house, should I hide? Who cares it could all be over in an hour anyway. Then suddnenly out of nowhere the voice speaks again...

Sixth Paragraph:
  "The first hour has past, you have a choice in how the last hour goes, make it a good hour to watch."  What does that mean?, Aren't they in control?, this is a nightmare, a bad Syfy film. I look up into nothingness, the only thing left is... Oh my god, People are glitching!, Did someone just dissapear? I keep whispering to my self that this isn't real and just a dream. I want to wake up, I pinch my are and I don't feel anything. I scream but no body looks at me. Everyone is gone. Why am I still here? Wake up, wake up, wake up.  

Seventh Paragraph: And to my dismay, I didn't wake up. This wasn't a bad dream, it was real, well as real as this "reality". I don't understand anything anymore. But I mean, I don't have much time left. I should try and spend the remaining time I have doing something at least. I come to my senses and start walking. It's so disheartening walking around and looking at everything that was part of my life knowing it's all coming to an end. I'm honestly not sure what to do...

Eighth Paragraph: As everyone sits there questioning, "what was that? what are they talking about?" But me, I knew what was going on. I had my suspicions. So as I was bored, I was remaking, as best as I could, a new Human Game. Going exactly what seemed right from my experience. It'd seemed like no one knew what was happening. I even tried to make it feel like it was real like this game. Now all i gotta do is wait until its over and try to start it before it erases everything.

Final Paragraph: I spend the last 30 minutes attempting to upload the new Human. My wifi connection is shotty. 300KB/s?!?!?! You'd think that in the last 30 minutes of all life on Earth, Spectrum would give me a break. The upload time says it'll take 45 minutes. We don't have 45 minutes left. Humanity is going to cease all because I didn't get a better internet provider. Take this as a life lesson kids. Don't use Spectrum.
